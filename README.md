# ideas-notes
This is where I put my ideas / notes / thoughts 


## Last update: Tuesday 15th April 25

# Currently doing / learning in own time: 
  - Docker ( bit late to the club, but never had a use case in my career )
  - Linux Server ( Personal Project, wanting to learn more about dev ops and deployment / security )
  - CodePills ( Started as a fun little project for personal use, is nearing first release as a Package for others to use )
  - Pocketbase - I absolutely love Pocketbase and plan to use it more in the coming months for personal projects
  - Galaxy Simulation, using ThreeJS for the render, and c# for the 'living universe' aspect


# Ideas / stuff I want to do
 -  a docker instance of a service for saving/organising and viewing your guitar tabs. The idea is that you can store them locally, incase they get taken down from your guitar tab supplier of choice.
 -  'VinylHitlist' - Let's make a service that hooks up to discogs. You'd set your "happy to pay" price, and sellers can log in and see who's willing to pay X for the record. Should be a nice compromise and get rid of scalpers.
 -  CSV - > pocketbase collection. A simple auto import tool for basic csv files into docker collections. It would make a collection and populate each field via node.  Could be useful for some people.
 -  "Home Improvement List" - a self hosted docker image / app that will allow you to plan out your home renovations, save research, products, have a home inventory of items/tools etc etc.
 -  Recreate the 'sphere grid' from Final Fantasy X in three JS / some graphics lib. Just a neat little weekend project.
 -  Runelite plugin, on teleport, camera auto faces north
 -  A rougelike game, where you start off with a broken space ship, and go on a quest between randomly generated planets, but your ship systems wear down / need maintaining.
